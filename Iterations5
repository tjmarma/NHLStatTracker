##Early version of breaking the loop after a team is found
    found = 0
for team in teams:
   response = requests.get("https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/teams/" + team['id'] + "/roster"
     players = response.json()['roster']
     for player in players:
       if inforeq == player['person']['fullName']:
         print(player['person']['fullName'])
         print("JerseyNumber: " + player['jerseyNumber'])
         found = 1
         break
     if found==1:
       break
